Breast Cancer Prediction
We use the Breast Cancer dataset, available in scikit-learn.
The dataset includes features such as radius, texture, perimeter, and more.
The target variable indicates the diagnosis: “M” for malignant and “B” for benign.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
We load the Breast Cancer datasetand perform EDA and split it into features and target labels.
The data is divided into training and testing sets.
• Implement the following five classification algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3.  Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN
We apply feature scaling to standardize the data.
3. Model Evaluation:

We evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and a classification report.
The report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for both benign and malignant classes.
